# Deno Docker

Docker images for [ry/deno](https://github.com/ry/deno)

This repo has two images `master` and `slim`. `master` builds deno from scratch and is hopefully a good reference for building deno yourself. `slim` copies the resulting deno executable from `master` if you would like to use it as a standalone executable.
